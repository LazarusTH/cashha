   - Implemented proper cookie handling
   - Added error logging
5. Build Verification
   - Fixed missing dependencies
   - Fixed webpack build errors
   - Verify build completes successfully
6. Date-Fns Fixes
   - Fixed date-fns client-side usage
7. TypeScript Updates
   - Next: Update type definitions for API responses
   - Next: Add proper error handling types


### Next Up ‚è≠Ô∏è
1. API Response Type Validation
   - Create shared type definitions
   - Implement Zod schemas
   - Add runtime validation

2. State Management Setup
   - Implement global state management
   - Add proper loading states
   - Handle error states consistently
    
    

3. E2E Testing
   - Set up testing framework
   - Write critical path tests
   - Add API mocking

## Next Actions (Prioritized)
2. Update remaining API routes to use new Supabase SSR package
3. Complete authentication flow testing
4. Add proper error boundaries for client components
5. Implement proper loading states for all async operations
