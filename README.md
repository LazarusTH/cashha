## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the Cashora project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher. ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))
*   **npm:** Version 8 or higher (comes with Node.js).
*   **Redis:** Required for rate limiting.
*   **Supabase Account:** Required for database and user authentication. ([https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/))


## Common Issues and Solutions

### Rate Limiting Issues

*   **Ensure Redis is Properly Configured:** Verify that your Redis instance is running and accessible.
*   **Check Redis Connection in Logs:** Look for any connection errors or warnings in your application logs.
*   **Verify Rate Limit Settings:** Review the rate limit settings in the `middleware.ts` file.

### Authentication Issues

*   **Verify Supabase Credentials:** Make sure your Supabase URL and API keys are correct in the `.env` file.
*   **Check User Session:** Verify that the user's session is properly set and maintained.
*   **Environment Variables:** Confirm that all required environment variables related to authentication are set.
*   **Verify database rules:** Check that the policies in the database are correctly set up.

### Database Issues

*   **Run Migrations:** Ensure your database schema is up-to-date by running migrations.
*   **Check Supabase Connection:** Verify the connection to your Supabase database in the logs.
*   **Database Permissions:** Double-check that your database user has the necessary permissions.

### Email Notification Issues

*   **Verify SMTP Settings:** Ensure your SMTP server settings are correct in the `.env` file.
*   **Check Email Service Logs:** Review the logs of your email service for any delivery failures.
*   **Email Templates:** Confirm that your email templates are configured properly.

## Security Considerations

*   **API Authentication:** All API routes are protected with proper authentication mechanisms.
*   **Rate Limiting:** We implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Input Validation:** Input validation is strictly enforced using Zod schemas to prevent malicious input.
*   **Error Sanitization:** Error messages are carefully sanitized in production to avoid leaking sensitive information.
*   **Secure Session Management:** Session management is handled securely to protect user data.
*   **Admin Authorization:** Admin routes have additional authorization checks to restrict access.

## Development Guidelines

### Error Handling

*   **React Components:** Use the `ErrorBoundary` component for handling errors in React components.
*   **Backend Errors**: Use the `AppError` class to generate errors in the backend.
*   **Input Validation:** Always validate user input using Zod schemas.
*   

### API Routes

*   **Input Validation:** Use the `withValidation` middleware for validating input in API routes.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling in your API routes.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Adhere to the rate limiting guidelines.


### Database

*   **Typed Queries:** Use typed queries with Supabase to prevent type errors.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for database operations.
*   **Migrations:** Follow the migration guidelines to keep your database schema in sync.
